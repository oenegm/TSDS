Developed a traffic sign detection system using Python, PyTorch, Keras, TFLite, YOLOv5, and ResNet.
Designed and implemented localization model for accurate sign detection and extraction using YOLOv5, enabling subsequent classification using ResNet.
Optimized the model for resource-constrained devices (Raspberry Pi).
